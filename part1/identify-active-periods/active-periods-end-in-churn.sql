-- Find active periods ending in churn and their corresponding start dates.
-- This consists of four CTEs:

-- - active_period_params - contains the fixed constants that define when the
-- program will find churns and the maximum allowed gap between subscriptions
-- that is not considered a churn.
--  - end_dates - contains all subscriptions that have end dates within the desired
-- periods. As a convenience for the next step, it also calculates the maximum date
-- for which an extension could occur to extend this end date: the end date plus
-- the allowed gap defined in the parameters.
-- - extensions -  contains every subscription end date that has another subscription 
-- that extends it (an extension). This is any subscription for a matching
-- account that begins before the maximum extension date (calculated in the
-- end_dates CTE) and has an end date in the future or a null end date.
-- - churns- a recursive CTE that performs the key calculation of the algorithm:
--     - the initializing SELECT statement is an outer join between the end dates and
--     the extensions, which selects only end dates that donâ€™t have an extension. These
--     are the churns. 
--     - the recursive SELECT statement finds earlier start dates for subscriptions that
--     come before the churn for the same account; the earliest of these is the
--     beginning of the active period.

-- We define a measurement date of '2020-05-10' and an allowed gap between subscriptions
-- of 7 days.
