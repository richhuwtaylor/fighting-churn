# fighting-churn

We need to rely on our knowledge of the business to decide whether a metric related to churn is causing retention and churn or only associated with churn and retention. To cause churn, the event must be closely related to customers achieving usefulness from or enjoyment of the product.

The distinction between metrics and events that cause retention or churn and those
that are associated with it does not make much difference in the analysis of churn related data, but it does make a big difference in the strategies we choose  to drive retention. If
we believe that an event or metric is associated with retention but not causing it, there is no point in trying to encourage your customers to take that specific action.
