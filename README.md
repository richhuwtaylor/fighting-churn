# Fighting Churn with Data

This project demonstrates how the usage and subsciption data or a product or service can be combined identify user behaviours which predict customer churn. This analysis can then be used to suggest tactics to fight churn.

The SQL and python scripts included in this repo are intended to be used on the simulated social network 'SocialNet7' dataset which can be generated by running the setup of [fight-churn](https://www.manning.com/books/fighting-churn-with-data) for the book [Fighting Churn with Data](https://www.manning.com/books/fighting-churn-with-data) by Carl Gold. 

The SQL scripts and Python notebooks of this project are split into parts and should be run in order:

### Part 1 ###
- [churn-calculations](./part1/churn-calculations/) includes SQL scripts for calculating:
    - activity event based churn
    - MRR churn
    - net retention
    - standard account-based churn
